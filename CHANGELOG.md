### Features
* Added support for RSA keys in key server
* Added support for 2 key server instances when using cdoc20-cli
* Added key server administration manual

## [0.0.9] RSA-OAEP support (2022-11-02)

### Features
* Support for creating and decrypting CDOC2 documents with RSA keys
* Improved Recipient.KeyLabel field support in cdoc20-lib (PublicKey used for encryption is paired with keyLabel)

* Added additional EC infinity point (X: null, Y: null) checks and tests


## [0.0.8] Two key capsule server instances (2022-10-31)

### Features
* The key server is composed of 2 server instances, each with its own configuration.

## [0.0.7] Minimal support for Recipient.KeyLabel field (2022-10-14)

### Features
* Minimal support for Recipient.KeyLabel in FBS header (field is present in FB header, but lib is not filling its value

## [0.0.6] server scenario implementation (2022-10-11)

### Features

* Key exchange server implementation
* CLI and libary support for key scenario
* Server OpenAPI changes (more strict string format for recipient_pub_key and server_pub_key fields)

## [0.0.5] PKCS11, LDAP and generated sender keys (2022-05-13)

### Features

* Refactor EllipticCurve code so that EC curve is created from certificate or public key. Interface support other EC curves
  besides secp384r1. No actual support for other curves implemented yet.
* Generate sender key pair to for recipient public key. Remove option to use pre-generated sender key pair
* Support for decrypting with private decryption key from PKCS11 (support for id-kaart)
* Support for downloading recipient Esteid certificate from 
  [SK LDAP](https://www.skidsolutions.eu/repositoorium/ldap/esteid-ldap-kataloogi-kasutamine/)
* Documentation updates
* First version server OpenAPI specification


### Bug Fixes

* Use zlib compression instead of gzip compression
* Delete all files, when decryption fails (last file was not deleted)
* EllipticCurve was incorrectly created from fmkEncryption method not Details.EccPublicKey curve 
  (no actual error as both had same byte value).


## [0.0.4] First release (2022-04-22)

### Features

* Create/decrypt Cdoc2.0 files with software generated EC keys
